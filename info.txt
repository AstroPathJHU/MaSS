This branch is dedicated to 2.3 inForm segmentation approach. 
In this approach the inForm segmentation output was a binary mask and not a label
matrix. This makes defining the cell objects much harder. For this task, we compute the
cell objects on our own and assign cells to the cell objects using their X and Y center positions,
which are provided in the cell_seg_data output from inForm. If a cell center lies on a cell border,
this cell is removed from the analysis. This avoids confusion and uncertainity in estimating locations.
The test directory contains the full operable MaSS.m file for this version of the code.
